### Currently includes:

* [Matplotlib](https://github.com/mtr-developer/python-cheat-sheet/blob/master/Matplotlib/)

### Installation
If you want to install a package individually, go into the corresponding `<package-name>.md` file for instructions on how to install.

From the project root directory:

via Pip:
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

via Anaconda:
```
$ conda install --yes --file requirements.txt
```
This will install all the packages to your environment.

### Future additions:
* Basic Python syntax
* (Probably) Pandas
